# Car rental system

The program is an implementation of a car rental system software in C++.

Working: The program makes use of a login and registration system through which a user can register once and login to their profile prior to renting or returning a car. Their profile shows whether the user has rented a car or not. The user on selecting a car and completing the payment procedure can successfully rent a car if they haven't rented one already. A user can return a rented car to rent again. 

The program makes use of the **fstream** class for the permanent storage of user information and **string** class for effective handling of strings. The user defined header file *rsa.h* includes the necessary user defined functions. Care has been given on the documentation and on ensuring the reusability of functions. 

Program will be enhanced upon gaining more knowledge. 

Thank you.
